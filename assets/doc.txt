 frontend developers your task
Using the JSON typicode test API, pull in all the posts and display them on your page. Make each post to be a link such that when clicked, it takes you to another page and displays the result for a single post on that.
You may have to look up using localstorage, how to route to a different page and how to use fetch to get a single post.
